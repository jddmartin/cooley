A Python implementation of the Cooley technique for solving for the 
vibrational energy levels and wavefunctions of a diatomic molecule.

For a description of the techniques see:
J. K. Cashion, J. Chem. Phys. 39, 1872 (1963),
http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1734545 (and references within).

For examples and tests see the "examples_and_tests" subdirectory.
